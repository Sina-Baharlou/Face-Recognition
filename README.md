### Face Recognition using Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

Face recognition is one of the most familiar applications of image analysis and has gained
much attention in recent years. Several computational methods are implemented in this field,
appearance-based subspace analysis still gives the most promising results. This project is
a comparative study of the most popular appearance-based face recognition projection methods
(PCA and ICA). The three architectures discussed in **"Bartlett, M.S., Movellan, J.R., Sejnowski, T.J.: Face Recognition by Independent Component
Analysis, IEEE Trans. on Neural Networks, 13(6), (2002) 1450â€“1464"** are implemented in this project, and built-
in functions of artificial neural network, and K nearest-neighbors are used as the classification
method. Also two popular databases for face recognition (Yale and ORL) are used here in order to
test the accuracy of the implemented methods.

### How to run 

Download Yale and ORL face datasets; set the parameters in 'nnTest.m' and 'KnnTest.m' and run them with matlab.
